#cpb
cp - with a progressbar

##What it does:
Nearly the same as cp, with a few differences.

1. Directories are copied.
    You don't have to set the anoying -R flag.
2. You see progress.
    There is a progressbar while a file is copied, indicating the progress and showing the files name behind it.
